**This page curated several baby steps in my life.**

# 2024

## The Applied Superconductivity Conference

I just received an invitation letter for the [ASC meeting](https://www.appliedsuperconductivity.org/asc2024/) in Utah this fall. 
I will showcase our work in the development of K-Ba122 bulk at TUAT and MgB<sub>2</sub> wires at NIMS. Hopefully my visa is approved!

## Science and Technology of Advanced Ceramics conference

I attended [STAC D2MatE](https://dxmt.mext.go.jp/) conference and presented my poster on the densification behavior of K-doped Ba122 bulk superconductor there!
We ate way too much and have fun listening to the material informatics session!

#2023

## The Advanced Materials Research Grand Meeting

My second poster presentation of the metal addition effect in Ba122 bulk superconductors!
