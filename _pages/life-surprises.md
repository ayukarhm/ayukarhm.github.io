This page curated several baby steps in my life.

## The Applied Superconductivity Conference (ASC 2024) in Salt Lake City (March, 2024)

I just received the invitation letter and will join the [ASC meeting] (https://www.appliedsuperconductivity.org/asc2024/) this fall (if my visa is approved). I will showcase our work in the development of K-Ba122 bulk at TUAT and MgB2 wires at NIMS.

## STAC 2024 in Tsukuba, Japan (February 29th, 2024)

I attended [STAC D2MatE](https://dxmt.mext.go.jp/) and presented my poster on the densification behavior of K-doped Ba122 bulk superconductor there!
