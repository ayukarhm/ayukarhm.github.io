**This page curated several baby steps in my life.**

# 2024

## The Applied Superconductivity Conference

I just received an invitation letter for the [ASC meeting](https://www.appliedsuperconductivity.org/asc2024/) in Utah this fall. 
I will showcase our work in the development of K-Ba122 bulk at TUAT and MgB<sub>2</sub> wires at NIMS. Hopefully my visa is approved!

## Science and Technology of Advanced Ceramics conference

I attended [STAC D2MatE](https://dxmt.mext.go.jp/) conference and presented my poster on the densification behavior of K-doped Ba122 bulk superconductor there!
We ate way too much and have fun listening to the material informatics session!

## The Advanced Materials Research Grand Meeting

I presented my second poster presentation of the metal addition effect in Ba122 bulk superconductors at the [MRM2023](https://mrm2023.jmru.org/)!

Finally I finished my bachelor's degree from the Institute of Technology Bandung.
The pandemic keeps me at home, here is the happy face!

## The Hult Prize Competition at TUAT

We brought home the *first place winner*! Mutia was our all-rounder CTO and Hua was our curious CMO. 
It was my first time being a CEO and one of the life-changing moments in my life!

## Going abroad for the first time!!!

I safely landed at Haneda Airport with major heart injury due to excitement. 
I was participating in the ASEAN International Mobility for Students (AIMS) exchange program.
This is how my relationship with superconductivity started.
