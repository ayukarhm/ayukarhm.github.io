This page curated several baby steps in my life.

## The Applied Superconductivity Conference (March, 2024)

I just received the invitation letter for the [ASC meeting](https://www.appliedsuperconductivity.org/asc2024/) in Utah this fall. I will showcase our work in the development of K-Ba122 bulk at TUAT and MgB2 wires at NIMS, if my visa is approved.

## STAC 2024 (Feb, 2024)

I attended [STAC D2MatE](https://dxmt.mext.go.jp/) conference and presented my poster on the densification behavior of K-doped Ba122 bulk superconductor there!
