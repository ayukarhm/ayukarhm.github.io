Selamat datang! (Welcome!)

My name is Nur Rahmawati Ayukaryana, a researcher from [Indonesia](https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/home). 
My field of expertise is applied physics and material science.
I am currently a master's student at Superconducting Materials and Magnets [Lab](https://web.tuat.ac.jp/~yamamoto/en/index.html) in [TUAT](https://www.tuat.ac.jp/), Japan.
More on my research [here](https://ayukarhm.github.io/research/).

Beyond superconductivity, I was hanging out in other fields as well such as first principle approach in energy materials [(solar cell)](https://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl/view/62497), 
energy [policymaking](https://aseanenergy.org/), phase field modeling in [irradiated materials](https://physics.anu.edu.au/study/projects/project.php?ProjectID=72), 
fault-tolerant [quantum computer](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article-abstract/2382/1/020007/783518/The-quest-and-hope-of-Majorana-zero-modes-in), 
and bending magnet design in a table-top synchrotron project.

It is pretty wild, isn't it! And I think we both agree to say that physics's [Scoville scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale) is infinity.
*My motivation is driven by new challenges and positive impact, for **a better world**.*

As you can view in this [page](), I have a deep attraction in photography and it has become my peacemaker. 
Fun fact, my parents and I raise **cats**! And I aspire to be the finest *servant* for them :)
