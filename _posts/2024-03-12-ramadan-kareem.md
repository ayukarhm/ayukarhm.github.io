title:  "The Quran learning experience during my childhood"

# Ramadan mubarak!

Today is my **first day of Ramadan** in Tokyo, and I am very *excited* because, as a muslim, this month is the one month devoted
for reflecting my past deeds and to seize the most of special prayers. It does not necessarily mean that other months are not for self-reflection, 
but this month is extra special because there are more prayers and sunnah such as fasting and taraweeh.
Lately, I have been feeling completely far from the path of truth and the remarkable thing I love about Islam is that 
even if my heart is [as hard as a rock](https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&verse=74), 
there is always a hope.

While I was born muslim, it does not automatically translate that I know more.
*The one who knows are the one who seeks knowledge*. 
I don't vividly remember how my first experience as a muslima was, 
but my first memory of Islam that still remains in my head is my experience in studying the Quran.
In this first post, I want to walk you through the experience and this is specifically dedicated to my teachers, 
*ustaz Purnomo (may he rests in peace) and ustaza Tun from the Quran learning center, Taman Pendidikan Al-Qur'an Al-Hikmah*.

My hometown is a rural area in Java island, Indonesia. I know my neighbors well and we have many social gatherings in the village.
It is pretty much like Stars Hollow in the Gilmore Girls but with completely different vibes and cultures.
There were one big mosque and a plenty of small ones called "*langgar*" in the Javanese language. 
The Quran learning center was located next to the big mosque (as per the old photographs), then relocated to one of the small mosques.
Students had three to four sessions a week (Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday) in the afternoon around 3 to 5 p.m. 

Every session would be opened with du'a recitation led by the ustaz/ustaza. 
After that, students would be divided into several small groups according to their ability to recite the [iqra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iqro) book. 
The book has six volumes in which a student typically finish them by grade six of elementary school. 
Hence, the student can recite the Quran by the time he/she is in the middle school.
One teacher is assigned to one group which commonly consist of five to six students with the same volume.
The teachers are the students who are in the volume 6 or the ones who are already able to recite the Quran.
The teacher would listen and quiz each one of the students alternately and students typically recite only one page in one sitting. 
If they don't have a clear understanding in the particular page, 
they can't pass to the next page for the next meeting. However, exception can be made if they want to pass more than one page per session
and if the teacher judge that they are capable to do so.
Meanwhile, the students in volume 6 and Quran recitation sessions are handled by the ustaz and ustaza.
After the Quran recitation session ends, the gathering is closed by du'a recitation again.

When I was in the lower volume, we tend to play a lot more than to learn and I think it created a good environment because
there was no pressure in learning. As I got older, meaning that I became the teacher, we were taught to be responsible. 
Nonetheless, we were happy to do it because the younger kids needed us and personally it was super fun to quiz them. 

We had this cute arrangement where students were given a task to be an announcer in rotation.
There were several lines to be memorized and said through a microphone which was broadcasted to the whole village.
In our first try, usually we would have several funny mistakes because of the nervousness.
I did the task too several times and I remember repeating several lines in loop because it was quite tricky.
I do think it was meant to be a quirky line.

The activities were actually not monotonous. Sometimes the session was switched to tajweed study by the ustaz and ustaza.
At times, ordinarily in the rainy days, the ustaz or ustaza would narrate stories of the Prophets. In other times, 
we would learn many kinds of du'a and the names of Allah. 

Our favorite moment would be this time of the year, Ramadan. We would break the fast and have taraweeh together.
After I am able to recite the Quran, we would stay at the mosque after taraweeh then reciting the Quran in turns.
We would buy snacks and share some stories when in break, then we would continue until around 10 p.m.
My most unforgettable experience was the night before eid where we would walk around the village while chanting Allah's name with 
our parents waiting to see us from the yard or at the front door. They would wave their hands with a big smile on the face.
During this walk, we would bring a small bamboo lantern which was made together with our parents the day before.

That was all I could remember! This community center was built upon voluntary actions of the students and non-mandatory donations from the parents.
Interestingly, this small center that originates from much smaller movement was able to create big social traditions which still exist at the moment. 
Moreover, it was such a memorable experience which, I believe, is felt by most of my childhood friends.
As a disclaimer, the exact system of learning the Quran was implemented in other locations as well.
And yet, it was the *best* childhood experience that I could ask for.
